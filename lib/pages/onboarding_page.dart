1) ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS AND CHANGES
By downloading, installing, or using MoveUp (the “App” or “Service”), you agree to these Terms. 
If you do not agree, do not use the Service. 
We may modify these Terms; material changes will be notified in-app or by email and will become effective on the stated effective date. 
Your continued use after that date constitutes acceptance.

2) WHAT MOVEUP IS (NO MEDICAL/EMERGENCY SERVICE)
MoveUp helps you monitor movements (e.g., trips and activity levels) and view personal statistics and reports. 
It is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice. 
The Service is not an emergency or safety-of-life system and must not be relied upon for such purposes.

3) REQUIREMENTS
You must be at least 16 years old (or the minimum age in your country), 
have a compatible smartphone and Internet access, and provide accurate information. 
You are responsible for keeping your account secure.

4) PLANS AND DATA RETENTION
Free (unregistered): data visible only for the current day, deleted within 24 hours.
Start: retained 7 days; Basic: 30 days; Plus: 180 days; Pro: 365 days.
You may request early deletion at any time (see Privacy Policy). 
Retention specifics are described in the Privacy Policy.

5) PERMISSIONS AND GEOLOCATION (INCLUDING BACKGROUND)
The App may request location and motion sensor permissions. 
You can enable/disable them in device settings. 
Some features will not work without them. 
Background location may be used to deliver continuous tracking; this may increase battery usage.

6) ACCEPTABLE USE
You agree not to use the Service unlawfully, dangerously, or to track third parties without a lawful basis and valid consent. 
You must not tamper with the App, upload malware, attempt to reverse engineer, or circumvent protections. 
Do not interact with the App while driving or in situations requiring full attention.

7) SUBSCRIPTIONS, PAYMENTS, AND RENEWALS
Paid plans are billed via the relevant platform provider (Apple App Store/Google Play) or Stripe.
Pricing & periods: shown in the App/Store at checkout, inclusive/exclusive of taxes per Store rules.
Auto-renewal: subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before renewal via your Store account settings.
Cancellation: takes effect at the end of the current paid period; access continues until then. We do not provide partial period refunds.
Trials/Promotions: when available, terms will be shown at sign-up; trial conversions auto-renew unless cancelled in time.
Refunds: governed by the relevant Store’s policies and applicable law.
Price changes: we may change prices with prior notice; changes apply on the next renewal.

8) THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
The Service integrates third-party services (e.g., maps/tiles providers, analytics, payment processors, hosting). 
Their availability and terms are outside our control; use is subject to their licenses and policies (e.g., OpenStreetMap attribution requirements). 
We are not responsible for outages caused by such third parties.

9) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The software, the “MoveUp” name and logos, and other content are protected by intellectual property rights and remain the property of $dt_ragione_sociale or its licensors. 
Except as permitted by law, you may not copy, modify, decompile, or distribute the App without prior authorization.

10) USER CONTENT
Any notes or content you create remain yours. 
You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, and display such content solely to provide and improve the Service.

11) NO MEDICAL ADVICE
Information in the App is for informational and wellness purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified professional for health or diagnosis matters.

12) PRIVACY
Processing of personal data is described in our Privacy Policy available in-app or at mytrak.app/privacy. 
The Data Controller is $dt_ragione_sociale. You can exercise your GDPR rights as described therein.

13) DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties (express or implied).
Except for liability that cannot be excluded by law, our total aggregate liability arising out of or related to the 
Service is limited to the amount you paid for the Service in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. 
Nothing in these Terms limits consumer rights that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

14) TERMINATION
We may suspend or terminate your access if you materially breach these Terms or use the Service unlawfully. 
You may cancel at any time through your Store account settings; cancellation is effective at period end.

15) GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms are governed by Italian law. 
If you are a consumer, the court of your place of residence has jurisdiction; otherwise, the competent court is $dt_localita.

16) MISCELLANEOUS
If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect. 
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.

17) CONTACTS
